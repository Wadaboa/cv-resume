# Curriculum Vitae
In this repository you can find my personal curriculum vitae and résumé, 
written in LaTeX and based on the template [awesome-cv](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). 
This template is not a package available on `CTAN`, but only on the author's Github page, so in the
`templates/` folder there is a copy of the original `.cls` file, with minor tweaks and adjustments to suit my needs.

## Dependencies
If you need to make this LaTeX project work, you will need to install the following:
* `FontAwesome` and `Roboto` fonts on your system
* `FontAwesome` LaTeX package, which is available on `CTAN`

## Notes
In order to correctly compile this template, you should use `XeLaTeX`.\
If you want to have a look at the CV, open the file [cv.pdf](cv.pdf).
